In 1966, Uncle Dan was working out of his home in Washington state combining various spices and packaging them in sandwich bags. Shortly after, Dan realized he had something special. Our 'Original Southern Dressing' (now called Classic Ranch) was the first recipe that Uncle Dan offered as a retail item under his newly established company. Now offering a variety of flavors, Uncle Dan's has grown exponentially. Uncle Dan's son, Chris, has taken over as President of the company, and to this day we still use the same great recipe Uncle Dan invented 57 years ago.",

With great attention to engineering function balanced with due consideration to product form, we have redefined the expectations of what and how aircraft lighting will be judged.See the difference. Feel the difference. Know the differenceAeroLEDs\u2122 landing and navigational lighting products are designed for some of the most extreme operating conditions on the planet.With the focus on efficiency, reliability and natural lighting, the company has introduced revolutionary landing and navigational lighting products that produce far better results than traditional lighting systems.AeroLEDs\u2122 introduced the world\u2019s first LED\u2010based Nav/Strobe lighting product that meets TSOs C30C and C96a\u2010C2. The PULSAR line was designed from a \u201cclean sheet,\u201d utilizing advanced mechanical/electrical computer modeling and optical ray\u2010tracing software to accurately predict the performance of the final product. The design addressed the shortcoming of the existing line of competitive products which includes: zero maintenance, reduced power consumption by 80%, no harmful substances such as Xenon or mercury, extended light performance, lighter weight, reduced Aero\u2010dynamic drag and is a direct retro\u2010fit when replacing legacy products with no mounting modifications.All AeroLEDs\u2122 landing lights have built\u2010in Wig/Wag that is designed to stand alone or be synchronous with any of AeroLEDs\u2122 other landing light products. AeroLEDs\u2122 landing lights are also designed to last longer than traditional legacy lighting and are protected against overheating with a built\u2010in production circuit to include lightning transients and ESD, voltage spikes, reverse voltage and under voltage conditions.",

As the pearl barley business grew, Alexander Co. began looking for additional value added business. Through research, it was found that SE Idaho was ideal for raising oats. By 2005, Alexander had built a new food grade oat milling plant to provide new markets for local growers and to provide broader range of products for our customers.As Alexander Co. grew, they began doing business with Cereal Byproducts Co. and in 2006, Alexander Co. and Cereal Byproducts Co. entered into a marketing agreement. Cereal Byproducts provides procurement and marketing services and Alexander Co. can concentrate on milling. Through this partnership, Alexander has expanded production capacity, increased warehouse space, and has added state of the art color sorting equipment to help improve both product quality and customer service. This relationship has allowed Alexander Co. to become one of the largest processors of pearl barley in the United States, shipping over 30,000 tons of pearl barley to customers from New York to California and Mexico.",

      "description": "Owning the earliest patent on 3D printing continuous fibers; our technology, known as Continuous Fiber 3D Printing (CF3D\u2122), constitutes a fundamental shift in the manufacturing process of Advanced Composite Materials (ACM). Our technology leverages rapid curing resins paired with continuous fibers creating a moldless, Out of Autoclave (OOA) composite manufacturing process. CF3D\u2122 can also embed functionality with fiber optics and copper wires creating a part that can sense and react to environmental stimuli.Composite materials with their low weight, exceptional versatility, and tailorable properties have been slowly revolutionizing high-performance industries for decades. We have combined these materials with the latest technology in 3D printing and robotics opening new design possibilities for manufacturers and consumers. Traditional 3D printing and the composites manufacturing industry are plagued with the limitation of only being able to stack 2D slices; our technology can discretely print fibers in response to loads oriented in all 3 dimensions.Our patented technology, Continuous Fiber 3D Printing (CF3D\u2122), is the cornerstone for the next industrial revolution. Our intellectual property portfolio consists of over 200 patented and patent-pending concepts and growing. We are seeking to develop and license our technology to industry participants in all sectors including aerospace, automotive, defense, construction, etc.",

      "description": "Jerry and Susie Larson, founders and owners of Mad Swede Brewing Company, are two Boiseans passionate about making amazing craft beer. Mad Swede is founded on the principles of brewing the highest quality beers by combining quality ingredients and innovative brewing processes.Over 30 years ago, while still in college, Jerry brewed his first beer. Jerry continued experimenting with new recipes over the years, meticulously recording different brews and methods, like a mad scientist dedicated to his art! Jerry and Susie both spent much of their careers working as engineers for Hewlett Packard, but as they both delved deeper into the world of beer, the desire to share their passion for great beer with the Boise community grew. Great beer is a blend of art and science!Jerry and Susie decided to open Mad Swede with the goal of making amazing beer using the practiced, fine-tuned methods Jerry spent years improving. Mad Swede is comprised of adventurous drinkers, brewers, dreamers, and thinkers who, like the Vikings themselves, dare to venture toward new and exciting territory.Mad Swede is deeply committed to community improvement. We are dedicated to making our community a better place to live through promoting local business, participating in events, supporting the arts, and striving for sustainability. Mad Swede provides a fun, safe environment for customers from all walks of life, and we aim to be an educational community resource about all things beer-related.",

      "description": "High-Performance Engine Parts Manufacturer Relocates to Boise from CaliforniaBVEP Stakeholders,We are excited to share that Project Muscle, The Blower Shop, has selected Boise for their relocation. Please see the press release below.FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: June 7, 2016Boise, IDAHO \u2013 The Blower Shop, a high-performance engine parts manufacturer for the automotive and marine markets, has announced that it is relocating its operations to Boise, Idaho from Simi Valley, California. In operation for more than three decades, The Blower Shop is recognized as a world leader in roots-style supercharging technology and manufactures superchargers as well as drive components for the professional racing industry along with street and marine enthusiasts.Ron Hayes, CEO of the Blower Shop, explains, \u201cWe selected the Boise area for our relocation because of the huge opportunity to expand the business within a growing region. Financially, it made sense to leave our leased space in Southern California and purchase a building centrally located in southeast Boise. We are a growing company trying to stay on the leading edge in our marketplace, and also expanding our product line within the automotive performance industry.\u201dThe Blower Shop has entered into an agreement to purchase a 13,000 square foot building in southeast Boise near the Boise Airport. It will house a full machine shop with both CNC and manual machines, and is expected to be online by August 2016.\u201cGood manufacturing jobs are key to a strong economy,\u201d said Mayor David Bieter. \u201cI am thrilled that the Blower Shop chose Boise. They will be creating even more job opportunities for skilled Boiseans and strengthening our city\u2019s forward momentum.\u201dThe Blower Shop plans to hire up to 20 full-time benefited employees within the first few years of operation, and will be working closely with the College of Western Idaho to support its training needs. The Blower Shop will manufacture, warehouse, sell and distribute its products all from the new location in Boise. The majority of its sales are to speed shops, engine builders, race teams, and other large distribution companies.About The Blower ShopSince 1984, The Blower Shop has been providing the top fuel, alcohol dragster and drag boat market with race-ready high performance superchargers. Leading the way in the development of cutting edge supercharging technology, the company focuses on increasing the performance of the roots style supercharger, making it the best choice for anyone in the racing industry. Today, the Blower Shop brings that technology not only to the professional racing industry, but to the street and marine enthusiast as well. Using its proprietary UDA technology, The Blower Shop is proud to manufacture a complete line of hand-built superchargers, intake manifolds, intercoolers, and components built in the USA.

With so many taps, and only 6 year-round beers, the variety is truly amazing.Cloud 9 also features a unique feedback process by which we judge what beer-drinkers actually think. We collate and analyze the input and use that to shape the direction of the next batch. In this way the community is involved in the brewing process from concept to the final foamy pint.A commitment to quality, service and genuine interest in our community make Cloud 9 Brewery the place for beer aficionados, foodies, and everyone who enjoys fresh and unique culinary creations.",

Merger\u2019s innovative mining methods will lower mining costs significantly, and reduce miners\u2019 exposure to dangerous situations they typically encounter when using explosives and traditional mining equipment.Aside from mining ventures, the Merger Laser Miner could find uses in the Construction Industry such as by-pass tunneling in the construction of dams, highway tunnels or the splitting of large rocks in landslide situations where timely clearing of highways is essential. Another proposed use would be clearing access to trapped areas in the event of natural disasters such as earthquakes or mine cave-ins or spelunking miss-adventures.Merger has world class technical experts to oversee the design and manufacture of the robotic laser vein miner arrays, and Merger has one of the finest mining engineers in the U.S. to assist the Laser Vein Miner design team with his mine design and operational expertise. They will be working closely at any mining location where Merger is testing and fine tuning the laser arrays, and they will be available to assist mining companies that purchase or lease the mining arrays from the company.",

      "description": "The American Dream. Everyone wants a piece of it as Thomas Wolfe once described it: \"\u2026to every man, regardless of his birth, his shining, golden opportunity\u2026the right to live, to work, to be himself, and to become whatever thing his manhood and his vision can combine to make him.\" When Glen Seekins founded Seekins Precision, it was no surprise to those who knew him well. He comes from a long line of hard-working entrepreneurs, so becoming one himself was only natural. Following The American Dream seemed to be engrained in his DNA.A 2004 deer hunt that was unsuccessful due to broken scope rings spurred Glen to develop a concept for rings that could withstand the elements of the Idaho mountains while weighing less than tactical steel rings. Drawing upon his mechanical design background, Glen returned from the hunt, fired up his CAD program, and spent the next few evenings designing Seekins Precision\u2019s flagship product: SP Scope Rings. He took his design to the machine shop that employed him at the time, and together they manufactured the first set of rings. The design of the SP Scope Rings has not changed since it was first mounted on Glen\u2019s hunting rifle.When the rings became extremely popular in the local shooting community, Glen\u2019s entrepreneurial spirit immediately went into overdrive. He continued to work as a mechanical designer by day, and by night, he trained himself on a rented Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machine and built scope rings. A few months later, Glen and his wife, Katie, took a leap of faith and purchased the machine, which they housed in their garage. During those early days, Glen would manufacture, assemble, and ship the rings while Katie managed the orders and accounting side of the business. By November of 2005, business had increased enough for Glen to leave his design job, and Seekins Precision became a full-time operation.The demand for Seekins Precision\u2019s products was astonishing, and it wasn\u2019t long before Glen and Katie relocated from their garage to a 1,500 square foot local business incubator. Around the same time, Glen designed and manufactured Seekins Precision\u2019s first billet lower and unveiled it at SHOT Show. Upon returning, he began designing a full line of AR products.After the addition of employees and machinery in 2010, Seekins Precision had outgrown their initial incubator space and moved into the largest one available, which was 7,500 square feet. They have continued to grow and are again out of space, but in August 2013, Seekins Precision purchased land for a building they will move into upon completion in March 2014. With over 25,000 square feet, it provides ample room for growth, an important feature since Seekins Precision has expanded to include more than ten major product lines (including complete rifles) since its inception.The Seekins\u2019 version of The American Dream has been realized in the ten years Seekins Precision has been in business, and they are grateful to the customers and friends they have made over the years. Drop in and see them soon at 159 American Way, Lewiston, Idaho.",

Our solution includes object oriented programing with adherence to industry accepted standards (ISA 95 naming etc.) from the plant floor thru the enterprise management software.Year Established: 2005t all started in April 2005, when Apex founders Lonnie Purvis and Marya Woods set out to provide high quality automation systems integration services to manufacturers and processors in the Boise, Idaho area. Talk about starting on a \"shoestring\"! Apex's first \"offices\" were their homes and coffee shops. They didn't even plan to hire their first employee for at least three years. But, Apex's work was in such demand, that hiring plan lasted only three months!Fast forward to today, and you'll see an Apex that's seventeen people strong, still growing, and doing business across North America and around the world. And, since 2005, we've outgrown two \"real\" offices, and just recently moved into our third!In order to accommodate continued growth, provide more and better services to our manufacturing clients, and to best represent our automation vendor partners, we've moved to a new, larger, more efficient operations and technical center.Website: http://www.apexmfgsolutions.com",
